# MOTOcare Auto

MASTER PROMPT FOR LOVABLE – MOTOcare Auto Service Website

text

Build a complete, modern, dark-themed automotive service website called "MOTOcare" that exactly matches the design shown in the provided screenshot (three-panel mockup of a WordPress-style auto repair/service site). The design is bold, premium, industrial, high-contrast, with a dominant black/dark charcoal background (#0a0a0a / #111111), pure white text, and a vibrant primary red (#e11d48 / #ff1e1e / #dc2626) for all CTAs, accents, icons, and highlights. The overall aesthetic is professional, energetic, trustworthy, and conversion-focused for an auto repair / car customization / performance workshop.

### Core Tech Stack & Architecture Rules (Solid Principles – Non-negotiable)
- Next.js 14/15 App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v3.4+ with full design-token system
- shadcn/ui for all components (Button, Card, Input, Accordion, Sheet, Dialog, NavigationMenu, Tabs, Badge, Separator, etc.)
- next-themes for dark/light mode (default = dark)
- lucide-react for all icons (consistent stroke width 1.5–2)
- Framer Motion for all animations and page transitions
- Centralized design system: ALL colors, spacing, radii, shadows, fonts, transitions live in one place only:
  - `tailwind.config.ts` (theme.extend)
  - `app/globals.css` (CSS variables + base styles + custom scrollbar)
  - No scattered utility classes for colors or spacing – always use design tokens
- Component structure follows Atomic Design + SOLID:
  - Atoms: Button, Icon, Badge, Typography
  - Molecules: ServiceCard, NewsCard, TeamCard, FeatureItem
  - Organisms: Header, Hero, ServicesGrid, AboutSection, Footer, Newsletter
  - Templates: HomePage layout
- Clean, semantic HTML, accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, focus rings), SEO-ready metadata
- Fully responsive: mobile-first, perfect on 320px → 1440px+
- Performance: lazy-load images, optimized fonts, minimal CLS

### Exact Design System Tokens (must be defined in tailwind.config + CSS variables)
Colors:
- background: #0a0a0a (main), #111111 (cards/sections), #1a1a1a (elevated)
- foreground: #ffffff
- muted: #a1a1aa / #71717a
- primary: #e11d48 (red) – use for every CTA, active state, icon accent, number, underline
- primary-foreground: #ffffff
- secondary: #1f1f1f
- border: #27272a
- accent red variants: #ff1e1e, #dc2626, #b91c1c
- success / other only if needed – stay strictly red + black + white + gray

Typography:
- Font: Inter or Geist Sans (prefer Inter)
- Hero headline: text-5xl / text-6xl / text-7xl font-bold tracking-tight
- Section titles: text-3xl / text-4xl font-bold
- Body: text-base / text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed
- Small labels: text-sm uppercase tracking-wider font-medium

Spacing & Layout:
- Container max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8
- Section padding: py-16 md:py-24 lg:py-32
- Card radius: rounded-xl or rounded-2xl
- Consistent gap-6 / gap-8

Shadows & Effects:
- Cards: subtle border + soft red glow on hover (shadow-[0_0_30px_-5px_rgba(225,29,72,0.3)])
- Buttons: solid red with hover scale + brightness

Custom Scrollbar (must be in globals.css):
```css
::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; height: 8px; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: #0a0a0a; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: #e11d48; border-radius: 9999px; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { background: #ff1e1e; }
/* Firefox */
* { scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-color: #e11d48 #0a0a0a; }

Dark / Light Mode Toggle

Use next-themes + shadcn ThemeProvider

Beautiful animated toggle in header (sun/moon icon with smooth rotate + scale)

Transition: all color/background changes use transition-colors duration-300 ease-in-out

Light mode should invert cleanly (white backgrounds, dark text, same red primary) but keep the premium automotive feel

Persist preference

Animations (Framer Motion – must feel premium)

Page load: staggered fade-up for hero, services, cards

Scroll-triggered: whileInView with once + margin

Hover: scale-[1.02], translate-y-[-4px], red glow, icon color change

Start by creating the full design system (globals.css + tailwind.config), then Header + Hero, then systematically build every section matching the screenshot layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy exactly. Use placeholder images that look identical in mood and color to the ones in the mockup. Make the site feel alive with micro-interactions while remaining clean and professional.

Priority order:

Perfect visual match to the dark red automotive aesthetic

Centralized, maintainable design tokens

Smooth dark/light toggle + custom red scrollbar

Framer Motion animations
